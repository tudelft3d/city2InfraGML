# CityGML Infra ADE

CityGML extension for modelling LandInfra features in CityGML. 


# Resources

The **UML model** of the Infra ADE was created using Enterprise Architect.  
- This [Enterprise Architect file](https://github.com/tudelft3d/city2InfraGML/blob/master/CityGML_Infra_ADE_v01/UML/CityGML_Infra_ADE_v01.eap) contains the UML model.
- Full UML diagrams in PDF format: Coming soon...

The **XML Schema file and codelists** of the Infraa ADE were derived automatically from the UML model using ShapeChange(http://shapechange.net/).  
- This is the derived [XML Schema file](https://github.com/tudelft3d/city2InfraGML/blob/master/CityGML_Infra_ADE_v01/XSDandSampleData/CityGML_Infra_ADE.xsd) for the Infra ADE.
- Browsable schema for the ADE: Coming soon...
- Codelists can be accessed here [Codelists](https://github.com/tudelft3d/city2InfraGML/tree/master/CityGML_Infra_ADE_v01/XSDandSampleData/codelists).

# More information

### CityGML

[CityGML](http://www.citygml.org) is an open 3D data modelling standard for the storage and exchange of 3D city models. It models the geometry, semantics, and graphical appearance associated with 3D city models. It is implemented as an application schema of the Geography Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3). The data model of CityGML comprises of a core module and several thematic modules such as Building, Relief, Bridge, Transportation, Vegetation, and WaterBody.

### InfraGML

[InfraGML]( https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) is the GML based implementation of the LandInfra conceptual model. LandInfra covers land and civil engineering infrastructure facilities, such as roads, buildings, railways, projects, alignment, survey, land features and land division. InfraGML is published as an 8 part standard and each part has a separate schema (XSD Ô¨Åle): Core, Features, Projects, Alignments, Roads, Railways, Survey and LandDivision.
